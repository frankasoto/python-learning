# 1 Setup

To start writing our first program, there are several things we need to do. Namely, we need to make sure to download python and install our IDE or Integrated Developer Environment.

### Download Python
To install python, go to the python site, python.org and download the most recent version, which at the time of writing, is version 3.15.1. From this page, you can also install a specific version if necessary based on school or work needs.
```
https://www.python.org/downloads/
```
After downloading python, run the executable (.exe file). Follow the steps. When it asks you to install, make sure you check the box add python.exe to PATH before clicking `Install Now`

- If there are any issues with installation, you would need to either grant your account permission to install python or click `Use admin priviledges to install py.exe`
### Install our IDE
There are many different options when it comes to an IDE. Some of the most popular ones are VSCode (Visual Studio Code) and Pycharm. You can even use a text editor like notepad. However, as I have a preference for vs code and it can be used with many other programming languages such as C, C++ or Javascript, I will focus on how to install and set up vscode.

Go to the official vscode webpage and click download: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
Click on the right download link based on your operating system. This guide will include the download installation for windows.
When asked for the different options, make sure to select `Add to PATH`. I also recommend selecting the other options to make it easier to open files. It allows for opening vscode on a specific file by right clicking it and selecting open with vscode. Adding vscode as a desktop will also make it easier to open vscode later however, it is not a requirement for vscode to work properly.

From there, click `open vscode` to begin writing your first program.
