# a # symbol will allow you to write comments in your code without possibly affecting your program. It's a way of telling
# python that you do not want whatever is after the number symbol to be included in the code

print('Hello World') # prints Hello World to the terminal

print()'Hello World' # Syntax Error: indicates that the way the code was written is incorrect. The error message will usually give you an idea of where it's occurring
print(Hello World) # Syntax Error. In this case, it's because we did not add quotes around Hello World making the program think it was a variable. We will get more into
# what a variable is later but a variable is used to store data for easy access later.
